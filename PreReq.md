## Minimum Computer System Requirements

No specific requirements, it is best to download the trial version to see if it will work with your current computer system.


## Supported Laser Hardware Controllers

- Ruida RDC6442G/S, RDC63344, LightObject R5-DSP
- Smoothieboard (including Cohesion3D Mini and Remix)
- GRBL and GRBL-LPC (Including Gerbil, X-Controller, and others)

(AWC708 support may be added after initial release, depending on difficulty)
New controllers added regularly, if your controller is not listed, please
contact the developers at lightburnsoftware@gmail.com


## Licensing
There is a 30 day free trial with no restrictions on the software.
The trial version will work with all supported hardware.

Once the trial expires, you will need to purchase a version for your hardware: The standard version for GCode based machines, or the Pro version for Ruida DSP controllers. The pro version will include additional hardware DSPs as those come online, and will include the Gcode back ends as well, however that is currently the only difference.

-----------------------------------------------------------

### GRBL or Smoothie: $30 one-time purchase fee
### Ruida or other DSP: $80 one-time purchase fee

-----------------------------------------------------------

Both include all published updates and bug fixes for a year. After that first year, the software will keep working as is, but won't be eligible for further updates. If you want additional updates beyond the first year, a small (probably $20) renewal fee will get you another year. Regardless of whether you decide to update or not, the version you have will keep working forever.

You can install the product on up to two machines at a time, so people with Mac/PC setups, or a PC in the house and one in the shop will be covered. Licenses can be transferred between machines if you get a new PC.
