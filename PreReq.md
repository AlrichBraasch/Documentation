## Licensing
There will be a 30 day free trial with no restrictions on the software,
aside from a small watermark on the output, assuming I can get that
to be non- invasive. The trial version will work with all the hardware
that LightBurn supports.

Once the trial expires, you will need to purchase a version for your hardware: The normal version for GCode based machines, or the Pro version for Ruida DSP controllers. The pro version will include additional hardware DSPs as those come online, and will include the Gcode back ends as well. 
		
-----------------------------------------------------------

### GRBL or Smoothie: $30 one-time purchase fee
### Ruida or other DSP: $80 one-time purchase fee

-----------------------------------------------------------

Both include all published updates and bug fixes for a year. After that first
year, the software will keep working as is, but won't be eligible for further
updates. If you want additional updates beyond the first year, a small
(probably $20) renewal fee will get you another year.
Regardless of whether you decide to update or not, the version you have
will keep working forever.
You can install the product on up to two machines at a time, so people with
Mac/PC setups, or a PC in the house and one in the shop will
be covered. Licenses can be transferred between machines if you get a new
PC.
