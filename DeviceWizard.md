## Adding a new device (Laser)
If you've never used LightBurn before, you'll need to tell it a couple things about your hardware to get going.

1. In the lower-right of the display is a box called "Laser" - on the bottom is a button called "Devices". Click it.

3. Choose a device that matches the one in your laser. Don't worry if you have more than one laser. Start with one for now, and add the others later.
