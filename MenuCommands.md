# Menu Commands

If you don't know what a button / option does, hover the mouse over it. Tool-tips are often added to help in explaining them better.

If a button doesn't seem to do anything or ever enable, it's probably a feature that's not written or connected yet.  There are a few of those - there is only one developer working on the coding at the moment.

The toolbars and windows can all be dragged around if you don't like the layout.  Whatever you end up with is saved when you quit.

### Duplicate
To duplicate an object select it and click on "Duplicate" in the Edit menu or press "ctrl - D" This is an "in-place" copy and paste operation all in one, and bypasses the clipboard.

### Convert to path

### Close path 
Click on "Close path" in the Edit menu or press "Alt + C"
### Auto join selected shapes
Looks at the start and end points of all the selected curves, and if any of them are close enough, connects them together into a single shape.
Useful when importing DXF files, which don't contain connectivity information. Click on "Auto join selected shapes" in the Edit menu or press "Alt + J"
### Settings
Clicking on "Settings" in the Edit menu will open a [Dialog box](Settings.md) where you can enter information about your laser and default application settings.
### Debug drawing
This is mostly an internal tool for LightBurn developers that shows the bounds of shapes being drawn.
### Convert to cut
Also an internal tool for LightBurn developers - It converts the selected shapes into the cuts that would be sent to the laser, and makes a new shape from the result.
This is not how you produce gcode / cuts for your machine, it's just a debugging tool. Click on "Convert to cut" in the Edit menu or press "Ctrl + Shift + C"
