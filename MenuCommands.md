### Convert to path
This converts a "shape" object, like a rectangle, ellipse, or text, into lines and curves that can be edited. The original shape information is lost, so you won't be able to change text with the text tool after using this.
### Close path

### Auto join selected shapes
Looks at the start and end points of all the selected curves, and if any of them are close enough, connects them together into a single shape.
Useful when importing DXF files, which don't contain connectivity information.
### Settings

### Debug drawing
This is mostly an internal tool for LightBurn developers that shows the bounds of shapes being drawn.
### Convert to cut
Also an internal tool for LightBurn developers - It converts the selected shapes into the cuts that would be sent to the laser, and makes a new shape from the result.
This is not how you produce gcode / cuts for your machine, it's just a debugging tool.
