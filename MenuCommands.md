### Auto join selected shapes

### Debug drawing
This is mostly an internal tool for LightBurn developers that shows the bounds of shapes being drawn.
### Convert to cut
Also an internal tool for LightBurn developers - It converts the selected shapes into the cuts that would be sent to the laser, and makes a new shape from the result.
This is not how you produce gcode / cuts for your machine, it's just a debugging tool. Click on "Convert to cut" in the Edit menu or press "Ctrl + Shift + C"
