# Weld, Add, Subtract and Intersection Vector operations.


On the left hand side of the tool bar there are 4 icons that allow you to combine (Weld) vector shapes, add (Union A+B) vector shapes, subtract (Boolean Subtract A-B) vector shapes and Intersect (Boolean A and B)vector shapes. Each icon is a visual representaion of what it will do to the sected shapes.

## Weld

Clicking on the Weld icon will join all the selected shapes into a single entity defined by an outline that is the furthest most point of each shape that was selected. The areas of the shape that overlapped are deleted leaving a single closed object.

## Union

Union is similar to weld, but works with 2 selected objects only. However these selected objects can actually be grouped items, not just a single vector shape.

## Boolean Subtract 

Boolean subtract is the opposite of Union. It will remove the area that the second selected shape overlaps the first shape by. The order in which you select shapes will determine the outcome. This tool also works with grouped items.

## Boolean Intersection

This will creatre a shape from 2 selected shapes that has an outline defined by only the areas in which the shapes overlap. This tool also works with grouped items.
