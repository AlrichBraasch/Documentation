# G-Code (Excludes Rudia)


## Generating G-Code
G-Code generation is real time and requires no action on your part to generate. 

Drawing in a layer or importing a vector file will automatically generate the g-code based on the settings for that layer. 

Importing an image will automatically generate raster scan for the image

## Saving and Importing G-Code
![Laser Module](/img/LaserModule.PNG)

You can save the g-code that was generated by clicking on the *Save GCode* button. This will prompt you for a location to save the generated g-code for review

You can import a previously generated g-code file by clicking on the *Run GCode* button. 

## Console (Direct G-Code Entry)
You can use the console to directly input and execute g-code commands. Enter a g-code command in the text box and pressing return will send it to the connected device.
