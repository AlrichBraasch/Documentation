## Tools and Toolbars

The toolbars and the tools they contain will allow you to manipulate your work. The function of each tool is covered in the [Toolbars and Tool Windows](Toolbars.md) section.

You can enable or disable toolbars by right clicking on any open space on a toolbar to bring up the context menu. This will allow you to turn on or off toolbars and toolboxes to fit your work style.

## Tool Windows and Tabs

Tool Windows provide a grouped set of tools for various operations. The function of each tool window is covered in the [Toolbars and Tool Windows](Toolbars.md) section.

### Manipulating Tool Windows and Tabs

You can undock a tool window and make it floating by dragging it away from the other tool windows. You can also click the min/max button in the upper right of the tool window to undock it.

You can dock the tool window by itself by dragging it to the right or left of the screen and dropping it in an area that highlights blue when you hover over it.

You can dock the tool window as a tab by dropping it on top of another docked tool window.

You can close a tool window by clicking the X in the upper right of the tool window or by turning it off in the toolbar context menu as seen in the [Tools and Toolbars](#toolbars) section above.

You can reorder tabs by clicking on the tab and dragging it left or right in the tab strip.

## Workspace

The workspace is a versatile interface for manipulating your drawings. Some ways to interact with the workspace include:

* Drag and drop supported files onto the workspace to import them
* Use the tools to draw vector shapes directly in the workspace
* Manipulate the size and rotation of shapes and images
* Move your laser head using the locator tool and clicking an area of the workspace
* Review your machine and job origin
* Type text

New features are being added quickly so this may not be a comprehensive list of all of the capabilities. Documentation will be added or updated as quickly as possible as new features are made available.

Many hot keys have been added to increase your productivity. See the [Hot Keys](HotKeys.md) section for details.
