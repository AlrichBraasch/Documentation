## General Usage Notes
If you've never run LightBurn, the first thing you need to do is set up your machine layout (work area size and zero / origin) in the settings, and then add your device type in the devices box.  If you have more than one type of laser / device, you can add more than one and choose a default.  At present, the layout and page size aren't associated with the device, but I want to change that in the future.

If you need to reset your device connection, simply open the devices menu, then hit ok.  LightBurn does a full disconnect / reconnect cycle when you click ok in the devices menu.

If you don't know what a button / option does, hover the mouse over it.  I often add tool-tip help to things to explain them better.

Most feature hot-keys can be found next to the action in the menus.  I've tried to put everything in menus and toolbars to make it easier to use, but also to make the hotkeys for things visible.

If a button doesn't seem to do anything or ever enable, it's probably a feature that's not written or connected yet.  There are a few of those - I'm just one person.

The toolbars and windows can all be dragged around if you don't like the layout.  Whatever you end up with is saved when you quit.
