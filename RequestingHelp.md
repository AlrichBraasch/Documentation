# Requesting Help for LightBurn

When asking for support for LightBurn via any social media outlets or email, please keep the following tips in mind for the fastest and most helpful answers.

* Please speak in complete sentences with proper spelling, grammar and punctuation. Fragments and run-ons are not pleasant nor easy to read. We understand that many of  our users are not native English speakers, and are more than accommodating, but some effort should be made from everyone please.
* Explain what is happening. A picture tells a thousand words, but we need at least a few words explaining the context: what did you do, what the issue is, what the machine is or is not doing, and so on. Also please include pictures of the full screen, and then use words to tell us where to focus our attention, as described above.

**tl;dr:** pictures and punctuation, thank you.

Other important details that may help diagnose your problem.  Are you running the latest build or what version are you experiencing this issue on?  When did the issue begin/ how long have you been experiencing it?  What operating system are you using?

**Spell it out for us:**  "I did *___*, I expected *___* to happen, but instead *____* did / did not happen.

Just a few steps to make the lives of the people helping easier, and to improve your odds of getting help.

Thank you.
