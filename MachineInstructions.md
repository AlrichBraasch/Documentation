# Machine Instructions 

Generating a file of machine instructions is automatic.  The type of file will depend on the device you've chosen, G-Code for machines that use it, RD files for Ruida machines, and so on.  Generation of the file happens on demand, when you press the Start or Save buttons, and is generally very fast.

Drawing in a layer or importing a vector file will automatically generate the instructions based on the settings for that layer. 

Importing an image will automatically generate raster scan for the image

## Saving and Importing Instructions

You can save the instruction file that was generated by clicking on the Save button. Save G-Code or Save RD File depending on your selected device. This will prompt you for a location to save the generated file for review.

You can import a previously generated instruction files by clicking on the appropriate Run button. Run G-Code or Run RD File again depending on your selected device. 

## G-Code Console
For devices that are capable, a G-Code console may be availble to you. This will allow you to directly input and execute g-code commands. Enter a g-code command in the text box and pressing return will send it to the connected device.
